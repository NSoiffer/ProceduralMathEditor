# ProceduralMathEditor
This is a step by step editor built on top of mathlive

To use this, you must get the 'dist' directory of mathlive from github:
https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/dist

Either create a sibling mathlive/dist directory to this project or adjust the values in the html files to point to the dist directory.

The debug version of the file is for being able to debug mathlive code as well as this project's code and requires a few other files.
