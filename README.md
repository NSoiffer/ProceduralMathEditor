# ProceduralMathEditor
This is a step by step editor built on top of mathlive

To use this, you must get the 'dist' directory of mathlive from github:
https://github.com/arnog/mathlive/tree/master/dist

Either place the dist directory as a sibling to this project or adjust the values in the html files to point to it.

The debug version of the file is for being able to debug mathlive code as well as this project's code.
